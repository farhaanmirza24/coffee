<h1><b>coffee history</b></h1>
<p>The history of coffee dates back centuries, first from its origin in Ethiopia and later in Yemen. It was already known in Mecca in the 15th century. Also, in the 15th century, Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers.[1] Coffee later spread to the Levant in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy in the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learned of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies.

    Coffee houses were established in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in Holland, England, and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands such as Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee.[2]
    
    By 1852, Brazil became the world's largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field owing to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass production of coffee has made it a household item today.
    
    Today, coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages, with a significant cultural and economic impact globally.

    <h1><b>benifits of coffee</b></h1>
    <p>
        <ol type="I">
        <li>Your brew gives you benefits beyond an energy boost. Here are the top ways coffee can positively impact your health:</li>
<br>
        <li>You could live longer.
        Recent studies found that coffee drinkers are less likely to die from some of the leading causes of death in women: coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Your body may process glucose (or sugar) better.
        That's the theory behind studies that found that people who drink more coffee are less likely to get type 2 diabetes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You're less likely to develop heart failure.
        Drinking one to two cups of coffee a day may help ward off heart failure, when a weakened heart has difficulty pumping enough blood to the body.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You are less likely to develop Parkinson's disease.
        Caffeine is not only linked to a lower chance of developing Parkinson’s disease, but it may also help those with the condition better control their movements.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Your liver will thank you.
        Both regular and decaf coffee seem to have a protective effect on your liver. Research shows that coffee drinkers are more likely to have liver enzyme levels within a healthy range than people who don’t drink coffee.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Your DNA will be stronger.
        Dark roast coffee decreases breakage in DNA strands, which occur naturally but can lead to cancer or tumors if not repaired by your cells.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Your odds of getting colon cancer will go way down.
        One in 23 women develop colon cancer. But researchers found that coffee drinkers — decaf or regular — were 26 percent less likely to develop colorectal cancer.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You may decrease your risk of getting Alzheimer's disease.
        Almost two-thirds of Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease are women. But the caffeine in two cups of coffee may provide significant protection against developing the condition. In fact, researchers found that women age 65 and older who drank two to three cups of coffee a day were less likely to develop dementia in general.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You're not as likely to suffer a stroke.
        For women, drinking at least one cup of coffee a day is associated with lowered stroke risk, which is the fourth leading cause of death in women.</li>
